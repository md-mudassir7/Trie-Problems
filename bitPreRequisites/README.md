Pre-requisites

    1.Bit manipulation

    2.To check if the ith bit is set or not in a number (num) we do (num>>i)&1
    i.e we right shift num by i and then perform & with 1 to check if it is set or not

    3.To turn on ith bit in a number(num) we do (1<<i)|1 
    i.e we left shift 1 by i to make sure that bit 1 is in the ith position and then perform | with 1 to set the ith bit
